# ChatGPT-PythonCLI
# Windows Command Line Chatbot with OpenAI GPT

This project aims to create a Windows command line chatbot that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model for generating responses. The chatbot allows users to interact with the system by entering commands or questions through the command line interface and receiving intelligent responses from the chatbot.

The chatbot's functionality is implemented using Python, and it leverages the OpenAI API to communicate with the GPT-3.5 model. To get started, users need to set up an account with OpenAI and obtain an API key, which is then used for authentication.

The chatbot operates in a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input. The user's input is sent to the GPT-3.5 model via the OpenAI API, and the generated response is displayed as the chatbot's reply in the command line interface.

The project provides a basic framework for building a chatbot that can understand user commands, execute them using the Windows command line, and generate meaningful responses. However, it's important to note that the code provided here is a simplified implementation and may not cover all possible scenarios or handle complex command line interactions.

Users can customize and expand upon this project to meet their specific requirements, such as adding additional functionality, improving the conversation flow, or integrating with other systems and APIs.

It's worth noting that using the OpenAI API for GPT-3.5 models involves costs, and users should refer to the OpenAI documentation for pricing details and usage limitations.

Overall, this project combines the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model with the convenience of a command line interface, providing an interactive and intelligent chatbot experience for Windows users.
